+++

I think of myself as an excellent coder (proficient in C++, Java, Python, HTML, TypeScript, CSS), who works well in a team, asks a ton of questions and is very passionate about technology and the way it changes the lives of people who have access to it.

I’m very interested in the possibility of working with Machine Translation or Natural Language Processing. I don’t have a lot of experience yet, but I would like to contribute to a product that changed my life, as it has changed millions of others' lives.

I want to make a portfolio to show other people what I’m passionate about and what I created just for fun.
